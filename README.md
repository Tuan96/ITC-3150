ITC 3150 - Database Websites - Fall 2018 - Northeastern University.
These are all the assignments submission for this class.
Mostly they are all written using PHP, with some of the latter ones that are written in PHP and MySQL.
I will update this folder frequently. 
I would really appreciate it if you can provide feedback for my code. Thanks!
